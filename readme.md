> ### [YOUR_FRAMEWORK] codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.


### [Demo](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)


This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **Polymer 3** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **Polymer 3** community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.


# How it works

> Modern web architecture using web components. Polymer is mostly a shim for the [Web Component API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components). The latest version is 3, and has major breaking changes with version 2. For the Polymer 2 version of the RealWorld app, see https://github.com/spirosikmd/polymer-realworld-example-app.

# Getting started

> npm install, npm start, etc.
